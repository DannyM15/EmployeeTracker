# EmployeeTracker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This project is to build an employee tracker where someone can view the lists of Departments, Roles, and employees.  This allows the user to be able to make changes quickly to their databases and view the information. I learned more about writing SQL queries and different methods of Inquierer.  Also joining the each table to each other was a difficult curve to overcome. My motivation for this project was to learn more about SQL as I find it interesting.
